<p>The Anarcho-Capitalist Party of Ireland repersents the true desires of Irishmen, that being to be free from all forms of oppression. The Irish people have proven that they will not stand being slaves or serving despots by fighting for their freedom in 1916 & throughout the 1920s. However, many Irish people have thrown back their freedoms to those that have taken them away. This can be shown with the "Real" IRA and how they belive in Socialism which creates a despot and reduces us to slaves again. It can also be shown with Cronyism. The current Irish government has sold out our economic freedom to big comanpies and particpate in a cycle of cronyism that will lead to economic and national collaspe. The Anarcho-Capitalist Party of Ireland will stand with the Irish people and stop this oppression!</p>
